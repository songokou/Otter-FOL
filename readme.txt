In the code submitted within this folder which is called "zli48.in",
it solves the crime scene problem provided in class.

In order to compile, first you should have Otter installed on your machine.
Once you successfully install it, you could run this source code by typing 

$ PATH/bin/otter < zli48.in > zli48.out

in the command line.

note PATH in the line is where your otter is installed. 
eg you've downloaded Otter-3.3f. the PATH would be something like ~/.../Otter-3.3f

you could name zli48.out as anything. zli48.out will be saved in the same path where
zli48.in is.
